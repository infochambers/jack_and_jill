The bog standard My Very First Whatsit, aka, _How_ does this thing work???

Good evening everybody.
How do you do you do?
We would like to introduce
ourselves to you.

People call me Luke,
because I'm not so hot.
And people call me Tinker,
because I tink a lot.

If you're interested,
If you have the time.
We would like to sing you
a little nursery rhyme.

Like Jack and Jill went up the hill.
Hickory dickory dock.
And Mary had a little lamb and
the doctor died of shock.

Hello Ba Ba Black Sheep,
have you any wool?
What the heck y'think
that's on me back y'silly fool.

We'll turn the black wool into garters
for the girls of whom we're fond.
And they'll wear them in memory
of those who've passed beyond.

Mary quite contrary,
how does your garden grow?
It grows very well because,
I've got a brand new hoe.

I put manure on me rhubard,
manure on me flowers.
You put manure on your rhubarb?!
We have cream on ours.

And then the cat played the fiddle
so everybody sing.
I wonder did it know that 
part of his brother was in the strings?

And then the cow jumped over the moon,
at least that's what we're told.
Expect it was because,
the farmer's hands were cold.

Or was she broken hearted
cause he felt her teats all year
And never had the thoughtfulness
to say "I love you dear."?

Oh, Mary had a wrist watch.
She swallowed it one day.
And now she's taking Beecham's pills,
to pass the time away.

We also do conundrums,
to tell you all the truth.
What goes tiddle, tiddle?
A piddler on the roof.

Now the time has come,
for us to go I fear.
So we wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy new year!
